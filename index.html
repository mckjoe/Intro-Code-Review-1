                  <li>We implimented a container to pad all of the content.</li>
                  <li>We used a jumbotron to hold the title and an introduction.</li>
                  <li>We included a section with block quotes to highlight pairing.</li>
                  <li>We used several helper classes to help us add emphasis and light styling.</li>
                  <li>We used <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and linked <em>bootstraps</em> as well for this project.</li>

                  <li>We used cascading to change the styling of certain elements nested within other elements.</li>

                  <li>I did this project at home because we didn't get to it in class, we did the band webpage instead, which will be the next project I discuss.</li>
                  <li>This project was fun because I got to add multiple images and I got to play around with some different styling and ideas.</li>

          <h3>Enough about all of the boring schoolwork that we have done so far at Epicodus, lets learn a little bit about the person that is me.</h3>
          <p>As you may have gathered so far, my Name is Joseph McKinney but I tend to be called Joe when people speak to me.  I have lived in Portland my entire life, but am very excited to try to learn a new skill (programming) so that I can pack up and ecplore for a while, hopefully living in a few different places.  Until I started taking classes in programming I was working t a New Seasons working in one of their bakeries and one of their deli's before that. I am completelty ready to be done working in the food industry, and that is why I chose to learn a programming language.</p>
          <div id="education">
            <p>My education is not that extensive.  I spent a year living in Corvallis and attending community college there, but I never really found anything very engaging.  Obviously there were topics that I enjoyed learning about, but nothing that motivated me to explore much more in my freetime, I was mostly just going through the motions to make my parents happy.  Other than that I have attended a number of community college classes (a very small number) but again never found anything that seemed to be that exciting to me.  I always had a hard time with the idea of having to take a really boring class to be able to then take the class with the subject which I actually wanted to learn about.  I felt like there was to much emphasis on what you had already learned, and there was no trust in the student to be able to work hard and get to where they need to be on their own.  It was because of that that I never really made it into higher level classes.  For high school I attended  Cleveland High school, which is located in SouthEast Portland.  I also attended middle and elementary school in SouthEast Portland.  Thank you for taking the time to read this oh so boring blurb about my education experience (or lack there of?). </p>

          <h3>I currently have a number of hobbies and interests, but I will only share a few of them with you, I dont want to bore you too badly.</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>First and formenost I enjoy photography.  Taking photos and editing them on my computer is what I enjoy doing most in life.</li>
            <li>I also really enjoy riding my bicycle around town.  I usually go out in the eveneings about an hour and a half before sunset and ride until about half an hour after sunset, stopping to take a picture of anything that catches my eye all the while.</li>
            <li>Another thing that I love to do is go hiking.  It is so very sad that our beloved Gorge burned down over the last few weeks, but fear not!  I went to the Washington side to go on a hike on Tuesday of this week and it still holds all of its beauty on our side, it is just different than it was before.  Be ready for a few years of beautiful wildflowers all through there.  Below is an image of the Oregon side looking at the Bonneville Dam on a hike I went on the other day.</li>
            <li>Kind of similar to hiking, but more of a combination between that and biking, one of the things I like to do for fun is go on long walks around my neighborhood and city.  I like to see the way things change as the days go by and the seasons change, and it is very condusive to taking photos of the place I live in.</li>
          </ol>
